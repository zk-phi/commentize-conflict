Prevent conflict markers from breaking syntactic analysis

コンフリクトでシンタックスハイライトなどが壊れないようにするマイナーモー
ド

** Description

This package provides a minor-mode which advices major modes to treat
git conflict markers and "their" changes as comments, so that they
will not break major-mode's syntax-highlighting.

** Screenshots

- without =commentize-conflict=

  [[./img/without.png]]

  =show-paren-mode= is broken by the conflict marker.

- with =commentize-conflict=

  [[./img/with.png]]

  lines between ~=~ and ~<<<<<<< feature-branch~ are treated as
  comments and =show-paren-mode= is NOT broken.

** Installation

Put this scrpit into a 'load-path'ed directory, and load it in your
init file.

: (require 'commentize-conflict)

and add hook to the modes you want to enable the feature.

: (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'commentize-conflict-mode)
